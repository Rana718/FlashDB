# Contributing to FyroDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FyroDB! 🎉

FyroDB is a high-performance, Redis-compatible in-memory key-value database built in Rust. Performance, low latency, lock-free concurrency, and minimal resource footprints are core project goals.

Please review this guide before submitting issues or pull requests.

## Core Principles

- **Performance First**: Any PR that causes a performance regression (even ~1%) without strong justification will not be merged.
- **Zero Allocations on Hot Paths**: Hot paths (`GET`, `SET`, `INCR`, `LPUSH`, `HSET`, etc.) must avoid unnecessary heap allocations, String clones, or heavy formatting macros.
- **Compatibility**: Redis wire protocol (RESP2/RESP3) compatibility must be preserved for supported commands.
- **Simplicity**: Prefer clear, lock-free, cache-friendly data structures over complex abstractions.

---

## Prerequisites & Environment Setup

- **Rust Toolchain**: Rust 2024 edition (stable channel).
- **Linker** (optional, recommended for fast builds): `clang` and `lld`.
- **Taskfile** (optional, recommended): [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (`go-task`).
- **Go** (for running benchmark suites in `bench/`): Go 1.20+.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for Redis Cluster baseline benchmarks).

To check your Rust setup:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

---

## Development Workflow

We provide a `Taskfile.yml` for convenience. You can use `task <cmd>` or standard `cargo` commands.

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Optimized release build
task build
# or
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

Unit and integration tests live in `tests/`:

```bash
task test
# or
cargo test
```

To run a specific test suite:
```bash
cargo test --test string
cargo test --test pubsub
```

### Linting and Code Quality

All code must pass `clippy` with zero warnings before submitting a PR:

```bash
task lint
# or
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

Format code according to standard Rust formatting:
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```

### Running Benchmarks

FyroDB includes an automated benchmarking suite written in Go (`bench/`):

```bash
# Start FyroDB in release mode (terminal 1)
task run

# Run full benchmark against FyroDB (terminal 2)
task bench-fyrodb

# Run key-value only benchmarks
task bench-key-fyrodb

# Run Pub/Sub benchmarks
task bench-pub-fyrodb
```

To compare against local Redis or Redis Cluster:
```bash
# Redis standalone benchmark
task bench-redis

# Start 6-node Redis cluster via Docker
task up
task bench-redis-cluster
task down
```

### Documentation

The documentation lives in the `docs/` folder:

```bash
task docs-dev    # Start local docs dev server
task docs-build  # Build static docs
```

## Architecture & Coding Guidelines

Before writing code, please read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the lock-free concurrency model (`CustomMap`, EBR, seqlocks, and thread-per-core event loop).

### Zero-Regression Policy

FyroDB is designed to outperform standard Redis instances by 2× to 16×. When touching critical execution paths:
1. Benchmark before and after your changes.
2. Ensure instruction counts, cache misses, and heap allocations do not increase.
3. Validate binary size does not inflate unexpectedly.

### Lock-Free Concurrency & Memory Safety

- In-place mutations happen under a lightweight per-key spinlock (`mlock`) and sequence lock (`seq`).
- Read paths must use Epoch-Based Reclamation (`EBR`) to guarantee reference validity without blocking writers.
- Never introduce global locks or long-held mutexes in the storage engine.

### Zero-Copy & Allocation Awareness

- Write RESP replies directly into `out: &mut Vec<u8>` using helpers in `src/utils/resp.rs` rather than `format!()` or allocating intermediate strings.
- Command parsing should operate on byte slices or `&str` references directly from the connection read buffer.

### Hash Collections & Data Structures

- For internal associative collections (e.g. within stored values, sets, stream groups, connection maps), use `foldhash::HashMap` / `foldhash::HashSet` rather than `std::collections::HashMap` with SipHash.
- `foldhash` provides 20–40% faster hashing for trusted keys and avoids duplicate hash machinery monomorphisation.

### Adding a New Command

When adding or expanding Redis commands:
1. **Define the command enum**: Add the variant and uppercase string to `string_enum!` in `src/commends/mod.rs`. (Command resolution is $O(1)$ via a static `foldhash` map).
2. **Implement storage logic**: Add the data structure mutation/query in `src/storage/<type>.rs`.
3. **Implement command handler**: Add the parameter parsing and response generation in `src/commends/<type>.rs`.
4. **Hot-path dispatch (optional)**: If the command is high-frequency, add a first-byte fast-path check in `src/handler/dispatch.rs`.
5. **Add tests**: Create comprehensive test cases under `tests/<type>.rs`.

### Binary Size Discipline

Release profiles are configured with `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, and `strip = true`. Keep binaries lean:
- Avoid adding heavy external dependencies.
- Avoid large macros that expand to extensive repetitive code or unnecessary trait implementations.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g. `feat/bitfield-command` or `perf/custommap-probe`).
2. **Follow Conventional Commits**:
   - `perf:` for performance optimizations
   - `feat:` for new commands or features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `test:` for test additions or improvements
   - `docs:` for documentation updates
   - `refactor:` for code restructuring without behavioral changes
3. **Verify Locally**:
   - `cargo test` passes
   - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` has no warnings
   - Benchmarks show no regressions for performance-related PRs
4. **Open a PR**: Fill out the pull request template with description, rationale, and benchmark numbers (if applicable).

---

## Issue Reporting

- **Bug Reports**: Please include minimum reproducible steps, Redis client used, OS, hardware, and expected vs actual behavior.
- **Feature / Command Requests**: Include Redis specification references and sample use cases.
- **Performance Inquiries**: Include full benchmark parameters (`bench/` command line, client count, hardware specs).
